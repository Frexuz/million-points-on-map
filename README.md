If you are into big data visualization on map, then sooner or later you will face this inevitable question ...*Can we show all the million+ data points  on the map?*

Well I have been haunted by this query for quite some time unless I came up with a solution.

Before I go directly into the answer let us understand some techniques and their pit falls.

##### Should I go SVG?
With SVG million points mean million DOM elements, thus making the browser slow and unresponsive.
Moreover the time taken to draw the million DOM elements will be large that it may make your browser unresponsive.

We can make use of some smart plugins like leaflet cluster, but this plugin displays maximum of 50000 points.
Refer: [50000 points](http://leaflet.github.io/Leaflet.markercluster/example/marker-clustering-realworld.50000.html)

##### Should I go Canvas?
With Canvas there are no million DOM elements like SVG, however you will need to draw a million points on zooming and panning.
So the browser becomes unresponsive during zooming and panning.

Its evident from above that a complete solution does not house solely in the client side. We need a server side component to handle this. 
Taking elastic search support (https://www.elastic.co/).

###### Elastic Index details
* Index name: points
* Type name: point
* Field *point* stores the geo point information, [More Info...](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/1.3/mapping-geo-point-type.html)
* Elastic mapping details as under

```json
{
  "points": {
    "mappings": {
      "point": {
        "properties": {
          "point": {
            "type": "geo_point"
          },
          "sentiment": {
            "type": "float"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The elastic query shown under operates on the map bounds(top left, bottom right) and zoom level to get all the consolidated points.

```javascript
{
   "query":{
      "filtered":{
         "filter":{
            "geo_bounding_box":{
               "point":{
                  "top_left":{
                     "lat":p.bounds.trlat,//top right latitude
                     "lon":p.bounds.trlon //top right longitude
                  },
                  "bottom_right":{
                     "lat":p.bounds.bllat,//bottom right latitude
                     "lon":p.bounds.bllon//bottom right longitude
                  }
               }
            }
         }
      }
   },
   "aggs":{
      "zoom":{
         "geohash_grid":{
            "field":"point",//filed on which the aggregation need to work
            "precision":p.zoom//zoom can have values from 1 to 8
         }
      }
   }
}
```
